# imagemultiplier

Image Multiplier is an AddIn for Xamarin Studio.

It adds a new file type '.multiplier' in which you can specify a set of output image files that
you want to create and a set of source SVG files you want to process. 

Image Multiplier processes each source SVG file against each matched set of output specifiers
to create PNG files. The output specifier defines the size of the image and the file name and
directory where it should be created.

From a simple text file and a set of SVG files, Image Multiplier can create all of the image
sizes you need for any iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Mac, or Web projects in your solution.

You can specify different sets of output image specifiers for each component of your application,
e.g. one set for icons, another for toolbar icons, another for App Store icons and another for
your web site.

To regenerate all your image files simply edit the .multiplier file and save it.

There is no easier way to create all of the PNG files you need for your Xamarin cross-platform
solution.

| Options		| Parameters	| Description							|
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :------------------------------------ |
| __type__		| 				| 										|
|				| `width` 		| Output file width in pixels.			|
|				| `height` 		| Output file height in pixels.			|
|				| `scaling` 	| Output file scaling multiplier.		|
|				| `color` 		| *Not currently Implimented.			|
|				| `ios_idiom` 	| iOS Imageset idiom.					|
|				| `ios_scale` 	| iOS Imageset scale.					|
|				| `ios_subtype` | iOS Imageset subtype.					|
| __process__	| 				| 										|
|				| `as`	 		| A JSON array of `types` to process.	|

Here is a sample '.multiplier' file:

    # This is a sample Image Multiplier specification file.
    # In here you define each of the output types you want to create,
    # and then provide search expressions for the SVG files you want to process.
    # Each SVG file is processes against the matching type specifiers to create
    # multiple PNG files in all of the sizes you need for your Android and iOS projects.

    # If only one the width or the height is specified then an it attempts to scale 
    # unspecified one is scaled to match. 

    { type: 'AndroidIcon', width: 36, color: '#f80c12', path: 'Android/Resources/drawable-ldpi/{0}' }
    { type: 'AndroidIcon', width: 48, color: '#f80c12', path: 'Android/Resources/drawable-mdpi/{0}' }
    { type: 'AndroidIcon', width: 72, color: '#f80c12', path: 'Android/Resources/drawable-hdpi/{0}' }
    { type: 'AndroidIcon', width: 96, color: '#f80c12', path: 'Android/Resources/drawable-xhdpi/{0}' }
    { type: 'AndroidIcon', width: 96, color: '#f80c12', path: 'Android/Resources/drawable/{0}' }
    
    { type: 'iosIcon', width:  32, path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}@1x' }
    { type: 'iosIcon', width:  29, path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}29@1x' }
    { type: 'iosIcon', width:  57, path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}57@1x' }
    { type: 'iosIcon', width:  58, path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}29@2x' }
    { type: 'iosIcon', width:  80, path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}40@2x' }
    { type: 'iosIcon', width: 114, path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}57@2x' }
    { type: 'iosIcon', width: 120, path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}60@2x' }

    { type: 'TabIcon', height: 52, color: '#f80c12', path: 'Android/Resources/drawable-ldpi{0}' }

    # You can scale an image with or without a width/height, if the height/width is left off then
    # it will use the svg's default size. 

    { type: 'TabIconiOS', width: 52, color: '#f80c12', path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}' }
    { type: 'TabIconiOS', width: 52, scaling: 2, color: '#f80c12', path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}@2x' }
   	{ type: 'TabIconiOS', width: 52, scaling: 3, color: '#f80c12', path: 'iOS/Resources/{0}@3x' }

    # You can process multiple directories, each with different type specifiers
    { process: './*.svg', as: ['AndroidIcon', 'iosIcon'] }
    { process: './tabIcon/*.svg', as: ['TabIcon', 'TabIconiOS'] }

Note how the 'as' parameter in the process instructions contains an array of 'type' values. These
refer to the output types defined earlier in the file. Each SVG file or directory of SVG files can
be processes against a different set of output types. This allows you to have different sets of specifiers
for App icons, toolbar icons, App Store icons, etc..

Note also that the 'path' parameter is a format string into which the source file name (minus the .SVG
extension) will be poured.

Each line in the file is a JSON object although the file itself is not a JSON object. The parser looks
for two different JSON object types: one containing a `type` field and one containing a `process` field.

## Setup / Install

You can install Image Multiplier from the `Addin Manager` menu in Xamarin Studio. Go to `Gallery` and look
under `IDE extensions`.

You can also download the `ImageMultipler_1.3.5.mpack` (or later) file and then install it
manually into Xamarin Studio using the menu item 'Xamarin Studio' > 'Add-in Manager...' and then click 'Install from file ...'.

## Build

To build the Addin package, compile the solution and then open a terminal window and run the following commmand:

    "/Applications/Xamarin Studio.app/Contents/MacOS/mdtool" setup pack ImageMultiplier/bin/debug/ImageMultiplier.dll

This will create the .mpack file which you can install manually by following the instructions above.

## Tips and Tricks

Make sure your SVG file has an valid XML header on it:

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

Note that no changes are made to a PNG file if it is already newer than the SVG file. So if you
change the image parameters but do not change the file name format string you will need to 
manually delete the PNG file. You can also `touch` all the .SVG files to move their dates up
which will force regeneration of all the PNG files.


## Future Improvements

Support colorization of SVG files to allow, for example, a red, green and blue version of an icon.
